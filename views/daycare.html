  <h2>Dog Daycare Services</h2>
  <p>Our staff has years of experience in the pet-care industry and have been specially trained to care for your pup while you are at work or on vacation. </p>

  <h3>Why Choose Daycare?</h3>
  <p>Daycare is the best alternative to leaving your dog home alone. Dogs that are left at home lack the exercise and socialization that they need to be happy, healthy pets! Dogs may also suffer from separation anxiety or engage in undesirable behaviors such as excessive chewing or barking out of boredom.</p>
  <p>Daycare provides your dogs with a safe, fun, and engaging atmosphere where they can spend the day running, playing and socializing with other dogs. Let your dog be a dog, and join us at Dog Hotel and Daycare!</p>

  <h3>The Dog Experience</h3>
  <p>The Dog Daycare experience is unlike any other that you will find. We pride ourselves on having a custom built facility that provides our pet guests with a fun, safe, and healthy experience.</p>
  <p>We offer our Daycare guests four large separate play areas. All of our playrooms are created with sustainable and durable materials to stand up to the toughest of play-pals. All of the materials used to create your pup's play area are non-porous. Meaning, your dog benefits from the cleanliest of environments!</p>
  <p>Dogs are separated to daycare groups based on their size, temperament and play style, to guarantee the best experience possible. All of our Daycare areas come equipped with custom dog-friendly playground equipment, epoxy floors, and a trained staff supervising at all times.</p>
